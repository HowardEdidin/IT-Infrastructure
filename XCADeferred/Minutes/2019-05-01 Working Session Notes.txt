Working Session - at ITI F2F

Minutes
Incorporate CP 1130? Yes
Beginning page-by-page review
Issues with GutHub/Word versions and line numbers
	In Joe's 4/30 version with tracked changes on, 3.18 header is at line 725
	With tracked changes off (final) line 574
	In Spencer's, at 790, and can't see second half of new interaction diagram
	Tracked changes off fixes line number, but still can't see full diagramx
Looking at 3.18 section that defines the new response slots for deferred
	Should we move this from 4.1.3 (Expected actions) to 4.1.2 (Message Semantics) because it just defines format and not behavior?
	Left as is but added comment
Stopped at 3.18.4.2
