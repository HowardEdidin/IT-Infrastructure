XCA Deferred Response option
Working Session
John, Victor, Mauro, Spencer, Elliot

Minutes
JM Will have to create variant of this transaction in both async flavors
JM Don't worry about moving alternatives to closed
Encourage responding directly to me if must
In option: all of the UCs are applicable but this would be used if response would be longer than X.
What happens if async and deferred are combined?
Discussing query returning AdhocQueryResponse for ack message
SL Consider relating messages in the body
Send HCID instead of endpoint, requiring lookup?
	SL Sometimes concern about getting a raw endpoint not via a directory
	JM Yes, some concern, but not compelling. You already trust the requester.
	JM Leaning towards HCID alone
MZ working on CP to add notification to DSUB
	Broker can be notified a subscription was canceled
	Might extend reason
	Subscriber can define subscription time
	Probably needs indicator of whether resubscription is suggested or not
		All work has been done
SL Like the option of a common sync/deferred mechanism, to handle already scanned docs
Need to add error code that means "come back with a deferred call"
	Still have this problem when one or two interfaces
	If has some ready and some that take time, do what?
		Maybe return PartialSuccess + come back deferred error

- MZ send CP to Joe

Actions - completed

- Add cons for XDW - too complex - done
	Add kind of XDW
- Con for DSUB - all participants would have to know responder requires DSUB - done
- Add Async flavors as alternatives, move to closed - done
- Ask community - done, but only recent. No feedback yet.
