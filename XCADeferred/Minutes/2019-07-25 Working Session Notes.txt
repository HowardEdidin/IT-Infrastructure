Completed TI Checklist
Did we line-by-line the entire document?
	Yes, not WSDL or schema though
How ready is it to go out for TI: Completely, Almost, Soonish, Hmmm
	Completely
How did the work fit in the allocated bandwidth? (Time to spare? Just right? Things were left undone?)
	Went over by one F2F, but the new continuous process relieved pressure to rush it. Also, shooting for an earlier F2F made progress happen continuously.
Review the evaluation. Which complexity/uncertainty/effort points missed the mark?
	Nailed it.
Or alternatively, estimate how many points you went over and assign the overage effort/complexity/uncertainty to the appropriate points.
Are all the open issues closed?
	Yes
What significant debates in TI-prep were not anticipated in the Kickoff or PC-Prep
	None. Nailed it.
What residual risks are worth noting
	Industry uptake
		Will address with new webinar
		Can pitch to Sequoia
		Epic interested
	Partial overlap with AS4
Does it feel we've met all the use cases
	Yes
Did the promised resources manifest
	Yes, review was great, AS4 support was great, editor top notch
What vendors are engaged (for each actor)
	CIOX (Responding Gateway), CONNECT (both Gateways), SSA (Initiating Gateway), Epic (TBD actors)
Who should specifically be targeted for TI notification (implementors & advocates)
	No specific ones
When will we have sample data/objects
	Got em
Do you need any tcons between now and TI Publication
	No
Was the profile where it needed to be at the start of the TI meeting, if not what was the gap
	Yes
Was the profile where it needed to be at the end of the TI meeting, if not what was the gap
