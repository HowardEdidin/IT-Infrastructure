Decisions made at F2F:
	Allow multiple response messages
		To handle varying processing time in federated sources and multiple RGs
	Return everything in query responses, including what had been returned already
	Return only content now available in retrieve responses, so all responses must be received to have all results
	SL For query, need to maintain complete list of all responses its gotten back
		Initiating actor needs to know what it had asked for
		Not a problem for retrieve, because what you ask for is explicit
	Reorganized content
	Renamed the deferred response message to Deferred Results
JL Gave initial response to AS4 questions
