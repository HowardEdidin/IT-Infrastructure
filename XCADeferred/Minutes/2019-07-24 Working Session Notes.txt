Review clarification of DeferredResponseEndpoint namespace

TI Checklist
Did we line-by-line the entire document
How ready is it to go out for TI: Completely, Almost, Soonish, Hmmm
How did the work fit in the allocated bandwidth? (Time to spare? Just right? Things were left undone?)
Review the evaluation. Which complexity/uncertainty/effort points missed the mark?
Or alternatively, estimate how many points you went over and assign the overage effort/complexity/uncertainty to the appropriate points.
Are all the open issues closed?
What significant debates in TI-prep were not anticipated in the Kickoff or PC-Prep
What residual risks are worth noting
Does it feel we've met all the use cases
Did the promised resources manifest
What vendors are engaged (for each actor)
Who should specifically be targeted for TI notification (implementors & advocates)
When will we have sample data/objects
Do you need any tcons between now and TI Publication
Was the profile where it needed to be at the start of the TI meeting, if not what was the gap
Was the profile where it needed to be at the end of the TI meeting, if not what was the gap

Actions - open
- Update samples – change to absolute time, add ihe namespace- Update WSDL – year in Action	201901020304
- Update wiki page
- Write CP to address WSP201
- CP for response/transaction
- CP for checking actual WSDL for soap action
- CP schema="IHEXDS.xsd"

Actions - done
- Draft brief closed issue for SMTP
- Add parent section headers in Vol 2
- Add actor headers for long sections like 3.38.4.1.3.3 (like 3.18)
	Added to 3.18.4.1.3, 3.38.4.1.3.3
- Duplicate language from 3.38.4.1.3.3 in 3.39 - about including deferred results in synchronous response
- Add sequence diag source per PRIM, mACM, mCSD, etc.
- Clarify namespace of DeferredResponseEndpoint
- Check XCPD deferred + AS4
	They can be combined. 3.55.4.1.2 maps the CorrelationTimeToLive SOAP header block to a ebXML Message Property.
	For XCA Deferred, we'd need to do the same for DeferredResponseEndpoint, and also address the corresponding mustUnderstand attribute and the WS-Addressing MessageID header used by the Retrieve transactions. Some editing would be necessary. It wouldn't be difficult, but should be done via a CP if the need arises.
