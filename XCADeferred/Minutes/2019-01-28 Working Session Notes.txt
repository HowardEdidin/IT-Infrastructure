XCA Deferred Response option
Working Session
John, Victor, Umberto, Spencer, Elliot

Minutes
Expectation getting to Feb F2F?
JM Want to present alternatives at F2F
Feb 18 - let's confirm
Should be nothing new at F2F
Still need proper survey?
	May not uncover much more
Survey implementers
	Can be hard
Warning/info code to say please use deferred/async
	JM Don't worry for now about making general
	ES Not a Vol 1 discussion
	Clients may need to apply business logic to be sync
Walked through XCA Deferred choices
Walked through DSUB Cross gateway
New CP 832 - notification that ?? is done
	Still waiting for the CP
	Wait and see
JM Need diagram with higher level
	Normal query/response showing hint
	Then subscribe
	When you see subscription get canceled you know it is done
VP Concerned cancel notification contradicts underlying specs
VP DSUB states you subscribe then query
JM DSUB only returns what's registered after you subscribe
Decision meeting for decision
Feb F2F depending on which solution, Vol 1 may vary greatly
JM Other possibility is write as separate profile
	Orchestrate cross community DSUB by profile invoking rather than Vol 2
	Could describe UC requiring init and resp and set of actions
	Kind of like mXDE, realize those are met by invoking another profile
VP Concern we are using subscription transactions for a different use case
Continue discussing over email
VP When we create solution look at where docs exist but require manual inspection
Service has indicated more is available - shift modes
VP Whole point of app level notification is performance reasons
VP Suggest add that UC to Vol 1
JM Invent as many abstract transactions as might be needed in Vol 1
	They can be collapsed later
DSUB to solve Vassil's UC?
	Doc exists but isn't yet available for the requester
		Requester is patient, diagnosis cancer, lab hold
	Business rule
	VP Or manual review
JM Need to make sure that DSUB advocates know this extra UC would negate it
There is no Vol 1 public comment
PC for approval into TI - all Vols


Actions - open
- JL Confirm everything posted on both
- JL Get Mauro's CP and see if we need an additional trigger
	For later
- JL Consider relating messages in the body if AS4 problem
- Option: HCID alone
- JL Generate remaining example messages
- JL Find out if both flavors of async can be used with deferred
- JL In option: all of the UCs are applicable but this would be used if response would be longer than X. (allude to UC)
- JL Reach out to community - ask about deferred XCPD + async
	How does RelatesTo work?
- JL Add option to use AdhocQueryResponse for ack message
- JL Advance option to use same request for both
- MZ send CP to add notification to DSUB to Joe
	- JL Review for applicability
- JL Add error code that means "come back with a deferred call"
	Still have this problem when one or two interfaces
	If has some ready and some that take time, do what?
		Maybe return PartialSuccess + come back deferred error

Actions - completed
- JL Generated example query and ack messages
- Debug my internet - done
- Need FHIR option that uses sub + DocRef - done
	We evaluated; it failed because it doesn't leverage XCPD/XCA
- Add cons for XDW - too complex - done
	Add kind of XDW
- Con for DSUB - all participants would have to know responder requires DSUB - done
- Add Async flavors as alternatives, move to closed - done
- Ask community - done, but only recent. No feedback yet.
- Get rid of the polling option - done
- Write up A-B test for DSUB - done

Questions
- Why is routing tough for DSUB?
