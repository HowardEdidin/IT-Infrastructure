XCA Deferred Response option
Working Session
John, Vassil, Matt, Spencer, Mauro

Agenda/Minutes
Walked through reasoning for decision - XCA Deferred over Cross-Gateway DSUB
	MB In FHIR space, are they doing triggered query
	JM Way too early in FHIR space to know how they would handle
	Bulk data pattern might be tried
		Large task be satisfied and notify when ready
	Group consensus acheived
Expectation getting to Feb F2F?
	JM Normally end of next week done with Vol 1
	Under continuous, can hit whatever milestones I want
	Could wrap Vol 1 early and Vol 2 later in week
	We as group help with consensus stds eval for Vol 2
	Go to PC with Vol 1 and 2 complete
In theory supposed to be phased - choose std after consensus
Next week will have a formal notion we will be done with Vol 1
Every F2F is a decision meeting
	JM But for co-chair benefit, tell them we think a specific session is for approval of Vol 1
When we do stds eval, we can do criteria
	We have spreadsheet to capture this
	JM and JL will take offline
Reviewed proposed Vol 1 text
How much info in Vol 1 compared to XCPD?
	No feedback from group
	Will carry this question to F2F
	JL May draft diagram for use
No further technical discussion today

Actions - open
- JL Look into case Initiating Gateway, grouped with a Document Consumer
	Should it instead be grouped with Doc Registry/Repository?
- JL Confirm everything posted on both - done
- JL Warning/info code to say please use deferred/async
- JL Consider relating messages in the body if AS4 problem
- JL Consider Option: HCID alone
- JL Generate remaining example messages
- JL Find out if both flavors of async can be used with deferred
- JL In option: all of the UCs are applicable but this would be used if response would be longer than X. (allude to UC)
- JL Reach out to community - ask about deferred XCPD + async
	How does RelatesTo work?
- JL Add option to use AdhocQueryResponse for ack message
- JL Advance option to use same request for both
- JL Add error code that means "come back with a deferred call"
	Still have this problem when one or two interfaces
	If has some ready and some that take time, do what?
		Maybe return PartialSuccess + come back deferred error
