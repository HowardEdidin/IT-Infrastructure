Minutes
M Vol 1 by Feb F2F
Choose tech soln by end of this year
Collect feedback from group not online
Fill out spreadsheet with criteria comparing solns
Spencer - addl UC - data holder wants to add human review before releasing docs
	Sounds like partial result
	JM Don't create impression that normal result has missing parts without saying so
	JM We want query consumers to know query tomorrow might be different from query today
	JM Don't invalidate existing model for not sure whether to return
		Human review could work with subsequent sync queries, so deferred is not required
Not adding emergency UC here
Q Do you have to know ahead of time?
Could we support an RG that could do either way?
	Likely would increase scope
	Little investigation
	Include in open issues
VP We probably need explicit deferred flag in body
VP Explicit endpoint (vs HCID) in body probably better
	MB Consider scalability
Q: Deferred XDS.b?
JM What about local PDQ to XCPD Deferred IG?
Why do the extra work for responding side?
Tentative - deferred for Doc Consumer only, explain others in open issues
- DSUB
	- Need to add cross-gateway flavor
	- Wouldn't know when we were done
- DSUB+XDW
	Interest made through DSUB
		Can specify a format code that says 
		Do to a specific doc id
			Could be a workflow doc
		First doc back is XDW doc that says "working"
		Then get clin docs
		Then updated XDW doc "done"
- XDW+XDR
	- XDW doc would need query filter info
- XPID
	Not an alternate solution, just something to think about with XCA Deferred
	BL If you send a query 

JM Intro text of supplement can be pages long
Public comment can come back and say start over
JM This could be exemplar of quicker cycle
VP Consider XDW+XDR out of scope
VP Next time list solns, pros/cons
	What is required for each soln?
If query for patient and it's been merged...
M Could be addressed as CP on XCA
	Would be supplement but drafted as CP
	Look at RESTful ATNA

Actions/Issues
- JL Start on the actual supplement, intro, UC sections
	Look at CP template, full new profile template
- Note: If we wanted to combine deferred with AS4, couldn't use an extra SOAP header unless you defined a field in AS4
- JL Could deferred/sync be done by same transaction, not knowing a priori?
- JL If XCPD deferred can work with AS4
- JL Generate example messages for group
- JL Dig deeper with deferred XDS.b
- JL Do alternate solns
- Q: What happens if patient merge or etc. between query and deferred response?
