useful notes to editors and reviewers

This profile needs to integrate well with PCC: CMAP which is a profile of FHIR $traslate and GET on ConceptMap
* Should ITI take this profile from PCC and integrate it into mSVS?
* Useful to see that NLM has used SVS for RxNorm https://www.nlm.nih.gov/vsac/support/usingvsac/vsacsvsapiv2.html
* and useful to see NLM profile of how they will use FHIR https://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/
